"Co-evolutionary control of a class of mixed-feedback systems" (arxiv link will appear here when available)

by: L. Venegas, H. Jard√≥n-Kojakhmetov and M. Cao.

Some remarks:

- Make sure to run each code on a clean kernel.
- In all codes, the main parameter is n, the number of nodes.

Figures in the paper correspond to the code as follows:

- Figure 2 up to panel (b) is produced by ```Ideal/u_ideal.nb```. Up to panel (a) with n=4 and panel (b) with n=100
- Figure 2 panel (c) is produced by ```Ideal/u_ideal_TV.nb```
- Figure 2 panel (d) is produced by ```Ideal/u_ideal_mismatch.nb```
- Figure 3 up to panel (b) is produced by ```Hebbian/u_hebbian.nb```. Up to panel (a) with n=4 and panel (b) with n=100
- Figure 3 panel (c) is produced by ```Hebbian/u_hebbian_TV.nb```
- Figure 4 is produced by ```Ideal_implementation/Ideal_Implementation_Synchronization.nb```. Up to panel (a) with n=4 and panel (b) with n=100
- Figure 5 is produced by ```Hebbian_implementation/Hebbian_Implementation_Synchronization.nb```. Up to panel (a) with n=4 and panel (b) with n=100
- Figure 6 is produced by ```Ideal_implementation/Ideal_Implementation.nb```. Up to panel (a) with n=4 and panel (b) with n=100
